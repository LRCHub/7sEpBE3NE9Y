[00:34.50] So bold and fine, I've known you for some time
[00:43.02] Whole life changed while bones like yours and mine
[00:51.33] Go dance in the woods and down we go, down, down
[00:58.98] Oh boy, you're mine, do you remember old times?
[01:22.48] 
[01:07.27] Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
[01:10.55] You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
[01:15.69] Oh, dear boy, I'm hollow without you
[01:19.83] In a world with everything, but it won't do
[01:24.07] Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
[01:28.06] You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
[01:32.35] Oh, dear boy, it's so hollow in the blue
[01:36.53] It's a chance, boy, everything and I can know you
[02:01.03] 
[03:04.95] Old love of mine, destruction ain't a crime
[03:13.24] For those who find love as a game, like you and I
[03:21.50] Go dance in the waters of all the tears we've cried
[03:29.36] Oh boy, we're fine, do you remember our time?
[03:51.86] 
[04:02.67] Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
[04:06.61] You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
[04:10.98] Oh, dear boy, it's so hollow in the blue
[04:15.15] It's the time for everything and I found you
[04:18.31] Oh, dear boy, I wanna follow you
[04:23.33] You're a wild boy, I am a wild girl, too
[04:28.01] Oh, dear boy, it's so hollow in the blue
[04:32.07] If you down, boy, everything and I can know you
